# dapp-course-truffle-express-box Digital certificates use case code.

Code reference for Dapp talk on Digital Certificates use case using Truffle Express-box


## Installation

I already follow the https://trufflesuite.com/boxes/express-box/ steps to use the `express-box`.

Make sure you `truffle` and `ganache-cli` install properly.

Install dependencies of the project.

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
truffle develop
```

If you want to run the express-box example (Metacoin)
```bash
npm start
```

If you want to run the digital certificates use case
```bash
node serverTecV4.js
```
